# NFT-Marketplace

NFT-MarkerPlace is a dApp that uses blockchain to solve the problem of certificate verifiaction. 
This project is made up of 3 parts:- 
1. Smart contracts that enable us to connect and do operation with the blockchain. Written in solidity
2. Frontend application made in NextJs
3. Caching system (Backend) made in NodeJs that keeps our application in synchronization with the blockchain.
In this project, I was responsible for the Caching system(Backend) and its integration with the frontend and the smart contracts.
